# Junior-Developer-with-focus-on-Testing-PreInterview ReadMe

 I opted on submitting the code on this platform so that the code be independent of any environment or IDE.
 I did not want to submit a code that include the project files, build scripts or any other redundant files generated by IDEâ€™s.
 
   ## Question 1
  * The first program introduced IsPalindrome boolean method. In the method body, I determined the minimum and maximum indexes inside the string.
    I scanned through from the minimum forward and from the maximum backwards at the same time. If the characters are different we return 
    false. If we are done scanning we return true.
    
  ## Question 2 
 * The second one uses a Vector for a set of data that will find a match that adds up to the sum. Then finds two elements from the list whose
   sum is equal to the target sum.
 
  ## Question 3
 * The last one, Subtrees rooted at nodes n1 and n3 are valid binary search trees as they have no children. A tree rooted at node n2 is
   a valid binary search tree since its value (2) is larger or equal to the largest value in its left subtree (1, rooted at n1) and is
   smaller than the smallest value in its right subtree (3 rooted at n3).
